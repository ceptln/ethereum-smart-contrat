# Anchor your intuitions in Blockchain

## Idea
This project is the deployment of a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain (Rinkeby Network) with Solidity and a web interface to interact with it. 
The idea is to enable any one with an Ethereum Wallet to write and store its intuitions and predictions about the future on the blockchain.

## Implementation
- Built and deployed a smart contract with Solidity on Ethereum Rinkeby Network (test network)
- Created a UI to interact with the smart contract

## Demo
The webapp is available here: https://waveportal-starter-project.ceptln.repl.co/
You need an Ethereum Wallet to interact with the smart contract.
